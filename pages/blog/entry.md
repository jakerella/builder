### Markdown Rules!

This should still use the basic Handlebars template.

This has a [link](/) and an image (below)

### There's also a small table:

| Foo | Bar |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1 | Column 2 |
| Row 2 | Column 2 |

### And some code:

```json
{
    "config": "files",
    "use": [1, "json", "file"]
}
```
